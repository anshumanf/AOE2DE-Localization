<b>Los ingleses (del 500 en adelante)<b>

Tras la retirada de las legiones romanas de las islas británicas a la Galia (actualmente Francia), alrededor del año 400, las Islas Británicas cayeron en un periodo de oscuridad que se prolongó por varios siglos y del que apenas quedan unas cuantas crónicas escritas. La cultura británico-romana que había existido durante 400 años bajo el dominio del Imperio, desapareció a causa de las incesantes migraciones e invasiones bárbaras. Los celtas llegaron desde Irlanda, de hecho, el pueblo de los Scotti dio su nombre a la parte norte de la isla principal, que pasó a llamarse Escocia. Los sajones y anglos llegaron desde Alemania, los frisones desde los actuales Países Bajos y los jutos de la actual Dinamarca. Hacia el año 600, los anglos y los sajones controlaban la mayor parte de la actual Inglaterra. Hacia el año 800, tan solo las actuales provincias de Gales, Escocia y el oeste de Cornwall permanecían en manos de los celtas.

Los nuevos habitantes fueron llamados anglosajones, palabra que proviene de la fusión de anglos y sajones. Los anglos dieron su nombre a la nueva cultura: 'Inglaterra' significa 'tierra de los anglos' y la lengua germánica que trajeron consigo reemplazó al idioma celta nativo y al latín importado por los romanos. A pesar de posteriores invasiones, e incluso de una conquista militar en fechas más tardías, las partes este y sur de la isla británica principal se ha llamado desde entonces Inglaterra (y su pueblo e idioma, 'inglés'.

En el 865, se rompió la relativa paz en la isla con una nueva invasión. Vikingos daneses que habían estado realizando incursiones en Francia y Alemania formaron un gran ejército y dirigieron su atención hacia Inglaterra. En un plazo de diez años, la mayoría de los reinos anglosajones cayeron o se rindieron. Solo los sajones del oeste (actualmente Wessex) resistieron al mando de Alfredo, único rey inglés que sería llamado 'el Grande'.

Durante casi 200 años, Inglaterra quedó dividida entre los vikingos, los sajones occidentales y un puñado de reinos ingleses. La mitad vikinga fue llamada 'Danelaw', que significa 'bajo la ley danesa'. Los vikingos recaudaban un elevado impuesto, conocido como el 'Danegeld', o 'el oro de los daneses', a cambio de mantener la paz. Se convirtieron al cristianismo y fueron asentándose gradualmente. Con el tiempo, los ingleses se volvieron contra los daneses y, en el año 954, fue asesinado el último rey vikingo de York. Por primera vez, Inglaterra se unió bajo un solo rey inglés de Wessex.

En el año 1066, el Witan, o 'consejero del rey', ofreció la corona a Harold, hijo del conde de Wessex. Había otros dos pretendientes al trono: el rey de Noruega, Harald Hardrada, cuyo apellido significa 'el duro gobernante' y el duque Guillermo de Normandía. El noruego desembarcó primero, cerca de York, pero Harold lo venció en la batalla de Stamford Bridge. Rápidamente, luego de esta pelea, Harold y su ejército forzaron el paso en dirección al sur, para encontrarse con Guillermo en Hastings. La batalla osciló a favor de uno y otro bando durante todo el día hasta que, al atardecer, una flecha hirió de muerte a Harold en un ojo. Durante los dos años que siguieron, Guillermo, llamado 'el Conquistador', consolidó la conquista de Inglaterra.

Durante el resto de la Edad Media, los sucesores de Guillermo se agotaron a sí mismos y al propio país con una serie de enfrentamientos y guerras encaminadas a expandir o defender sus posesiones en Francia: la Guerra de los Cien Años entre Inglaterra y Francia se extendió desde 1337 hasta 1453. La aspiración de un rey inglés al trono de Francia, debido a enlaces matrimoniales, fue el detonante del conflicto. Otras causas de esta guerra fueron la lucha por el control del lucrativo mercado de la lana y, entre otros antecedentes, el apoyo francés a la independencia de Escocia. En sus inicios, la guerra se caracterizó por una serie de inesperadas victorias de los ingleses, normalmente debidas a la pericia de los arqueros que, con sus armas de largo alcance, barrían las filas de vistosas armaduras de la caballería francesa.

Sin embargo, los ingleses no consiguieron alcanzar una victoria definitiva y los franceses poco a poco fueron reagrupándose. Inspirados por Juana de Arco, una joven campesina que decía actuar bajo mandato divino, los franceses contraatacaron, triunfando con la toma de Burdeos en 1453. La única posesión que les quedó a los ingleses en el continente fue la región de Calais, aunque no por mucho tiempo.





































s and Saxons controlled most of modern England. By 800, only modern Wales, Scotland, and West Cornwall remained in largely Celtic hands.

The new inhabitants were called Anglo-Saxons (from the Angles and Saxons). The Angles gave their name to the new culture (England from Angle-land), and the Germanic language they brought with them, English, replaced the native Celtic and previously imported Latin. Despite further invasions and even a complete military conquest at a later date, the southern and eastern parts of the largest British Isle have been called England (and its people and language English) ever since.

In 865 the relative peace of England was shattered by a new invasion. Danish Vikings who had been raiding France and Germany formed a great army and turned their attention on the English. Within 10 years, most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had fallen or surrendered. Only the West Saxons (modern Wessex) held out under Alfred, the only English ruler to be called "the Great."

England was divided among the Vikings, the West Saxons, and a few other English kingdoms for nearly 200 years. The Viking half was called the Danelaw ("under Danish law"). The Vikings collected a large payment, called the Danegeld ("the Dane's gold"), to be peaceful. The Danes became Christians and gradually became more settled. In time the English turned on the Danes, and in 954 the last Viking king of York was killed. England was united for the first time under an English king from Wessex.

In 1066 the Witan ("king's council") offered the crown to Harold, son of the Earl of Wessex. Two others claimed the throne: Harald Hardrada (meaning "the hard ruler"), King of Norway, and Duke William of Normandy. The Norwegian landed first, near York, but was defeated by Harold at the battle of Stamford Bridge. Immediately after the victory, Harold force-marched his army south to meet William at Hastings. The battle seesawed back and forth all day, but near dusk Harold was mortally wounded by an arrow in the eye. Over the next two years, William, now "the Conqueror," solidified his conquest of England.

During the remainder of the Middle Ages, the successors of William largely exhausted themselves and their country in a series of confrontations and wars attempting to expand or defend land holdings in France. The Hundred Years War between England and France was an on-and-off conflict that stretched from 1337 to 1453. It was triggered by an English king's claim to the throne of France, thanks to family intermarriages. The war was also fought over control of the lucrative wool trade and French support for Scotland's independence. The early part of the war featured a string of improbable, yet complete, English victories, thanks usually to English longbowmen mowing down hordes of ornately armored French knights from long range.

The English could not bring the war to closure, however, and the French rallied. Inspired by Joan of Arc, a peasant girl who professed divine guidance, the French fought back, ending the war with the capture of Bordeaux in 1453. The English were left holding only Calais on the mainland (and not for long).

Following the withdrawal of the Roman legions to Gaul (modern France) around 400, the British Isles fell into a very dark period of several centuries from which almost no written records survive. The Romano-British culture that had existed under 400 years of Roman rule disappeared under relentless invasion and migration by barbarians. Celts came over from Ireland (a tribe called the Scotti gave their name to the northern part of the main island, Scotland). Saxons and Angles came from Germany, Frisians from modern Holland, and Jutes from modern Denmark. By 600, the Angles and Saxons controlled most of modern England.
